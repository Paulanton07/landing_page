this is a review to correct page structure and placement of elements.

1. the Page1, Page2, Page3 links should be renamed to reflect the name of connected element.
page1 "download pdf price list"
page2 "send order email"
page3 "more-about"

all three menu links should be placed to the right of the header/page.

2. the logo should be 50% larger and the word "sales" must be placed to the left of the logo image.

3. can you add functionality so that the page renders well on all size screens.

4. the three images <section class="images" id="page1">
renders too flat and too long on the page can you adjust image size so that they look good in proportion to the rest of elements.

5. the <header> is static but takes up almost half of the page. can you reduce it by 40%.

6. the download PDF Price List and Send Order Email buttons should be placed in the center of page.

7. the video should be to the left of the page.

8. the card "more-about" must have flex so when I add content it will fit, also the card is at the bottom by footer .
place card in the <body> to the right of the video.
